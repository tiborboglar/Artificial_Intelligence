This is a repository with some of the projects I developed throughout the Artificial Intelligence course at University of SÃ£o Paulo. The course was subdivided into various modules, containing some of the following topics:
1. State space search: Breadth-first search, Depth-first search, Uniform cost search, A* search and expectimax search.
2. Probabilistic Reasoning: Hidden-markov chains, Bayesian networks and Value-Iteration (when dealing with reinforcement learning)
3. Machine Learning: Q-Learning and Supervised Learning (kNN, Decision Trees, Perceptron, Neural Networks)


### Project 1: Segmentation of Words using Uniform Cost Search
First part: Given a query, such as 'thisisnotarealword', find the proper places to insert whitespaces using uniform cost search, resulting in the proper readable string 'this is not a real word'. 

Second part: Proper insertion of vowels, given a phrase such as 'hll my nm s', return 'hello my name is'.

### Project 2: Developing planning agents
The objective is to develop a planning agent to play a game in a grid world, you're playing as a yellow taxi cab against a black taxi cab. Your car has to collect passengers without running out of fuel, some characters gives more points than others. (The characters within the game are the professor and TA's)
