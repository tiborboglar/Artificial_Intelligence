This is a repository with some of the projects I developed througout the Artificial Intelligence course at University of SÃ£o Paulo. The course was subdivided into various modules, containing some of the following topics:
1. State space search: Breadth-first search, Depth-first search, Uniform cost search, A* search and expectimax search.
2. Probabilistic Reasoning: Hidden-markov chains, Bayesian networks and Value-Iteration (when dealing with reinforcement learning)
3. Machine Learning: Q-Learning and Supervised Learning (kNN, Decision Trees, Perceptron, Neural Networks)


### Project 1: Segmentation of Words using Uniform Cost Search
First part: Given a query, such as 'thisisnotarealword', find the proper places to insert whitespaces using uniform cost search, resulting in the proper readable string 'this is not a real word'. 

Second part: Proper insertion of vowels, given a phrase such as 'hll my nm s', return 'hello my name is'.
