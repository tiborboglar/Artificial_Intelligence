# Artificial Intelligence
Some algorithms I developed thoughout my undergrad studies.

1. Segmentation of Words: 
  - Given a query, such as 'thisisnotarealword', find the proper places to insert whitespaces using uniform cost search, resulting in the proper readable string 'this is not a real word'. 
  
2. Insertion of Vowels:
  - Given a query, such as 'hll hw r y?', insert the vowels into proper place, in this example we should return 'hello how are you', solving using uniform cost search too. 
  - To be fair, it's not working in the greatest way, also because is kind of hard to say 'f y ct' means 'if you act', other than any other thing.
