This is a repository with some of the projects I developed througout the Artificial Intelligence course at University of SÃ£o Paulo. The course was subdivided into various modules, containing some of the following topics:
1. State space search: Breadth-first search, Depth-first search, Uniform cost search, A* search and expectimax search.
2. Probabilistic Reasoning: Hidden-markov chains, Bayesian networks and Value-Iteration (when dealing with reinforcement learning)
3. Machine Learning: Q-Learning and Supervised Learning (kNN, Decision Trees, Perceptron, Neural Networks)


1. Segmentation of Words: 
  - Given a query, such as 'thisisnotarealword', find the proper places to insert whitespaces using uniform cost search, resulting in the proper readable string 'this is not a real word'. 
  
2. Insertion of Vowels:
  - Given a query, such as 'hll hw r y?', insert the vowels into proper place, in this example we should return 'hello how are you', solving using uniform cost search too. 
  - To be fair, it's not working in the greatest way, also because is kind of hard to say 'f y ct' means 'if you act', other than any other thing.
